# Moneyball

Github repository for the Moneyball project in Algorithmics for Data Mining (MIRI-UPC).

This repository holds a Python notebook with some examples on how to calculate the OPS for any player of the MLB, given a year. Then, this result is plotted against the salary these players are obtaining to find the most efficient player in terms of OPS.

Also an analysis over the cost per wins for the best 6 teams in that season was performed. 

The `data` directory holds several csv files with data from [Sean Lahman Baseball archive](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics).

This project uses as a basis [ahartz1 project](https://github.com/ahartz1/moneyball), thank you so much mate.
